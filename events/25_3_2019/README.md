# Bayesian Modelling with R

## Jiali Wang

### Event Description

Bayesian models become more prominent thanks to the modern computing
technologies. In this meeting, you will take a Bayes tour with Jiali
(Data61, CSIRO) of the basics in Bayesian inference, coding from scratch
in R and implementation using Stan software (interface with R)\! A
normal model will serve as the building block, and then you will go
through examples of hierarchical models and semi-parametric models for
multilevel data or longitudinal data (different disciplines have
different names for essentially the same model, but we will
convergence\!) The R examples will be demonstrated in R Markdown, so
please come along if you are interested in learning basics of R
Markdown.

Bringing a laptop is totally optional, but you are encouraged to do so
if you are keen on having some hands-on experiences of running your own
Bayesian models. Donâ€™t worry about taking notes, all the materials and R
code will be shared with you later.

There will be time for discussions /networking after the tutorial, so
make sure to bring any of your questions; there might be experts in the
room who can help solving your problems\!
