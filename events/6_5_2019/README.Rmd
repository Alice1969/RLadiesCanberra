# Tidying and Plotting in R
## Hedvig Skirg√•rd

Hedvig has kindly shared her slides from this event: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11BE_fQv_ov8cCflxCcqa8tC3NY7u1UKH.

### Event Description

R is primarily known as a tool for statistics and data analysis, but it is also great for "simpler" data wrangling and plotting purposes. As R is becoming more accessible and useful in this regards, it is becoming a more viable alternative to Microsoft Excel and other spreadsheet-based applications for wrangling, analysing and visualising data. This has resulted in more R-users who are not from the "hardcore" STEM disciplines - like linguists, psychologists and researchers in political science. In this talk, Hedvig will introduce the concept of tidy data, the wonders of the tidyverse and ggplot for beginner users of R and experienced users who mainly use non-tidyverse packages.

### Biography
