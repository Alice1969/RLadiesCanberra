### Event Description

RLadies Canberra is pleased to announce an online code-along for their
final event in a very eventful year\! RLadies from across Australia and
New Zealand have been invited through their local groups. This event is
targeted for less experienced users of R, but all users are welcome to
attend.

Erika Duan will be leading the code-along, introducing data
visualisation using ggplot. We’ll code for about half an hour, then
break out into smaller groups for meet-and-greet, then return to coding
for another half hour before closing with a second breakout.

The event is online, and once you RSVP you will be sent a Zoom link.
RLadies Canberra is looking forward to seeing you there\!
