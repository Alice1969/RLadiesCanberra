# R-Ladies Canberra Launch

### Event Description

Hi R-Ladies and those that are interested in supporting gender diversity
in the R community\! We are thrilled to announce that R-Ladies Canberra
is launching on Tue 26th February\!

You are all invited to give a lightning talk about ANYTHING related to
R, including but not limited to:

  - Your past experience of using R;
  - Your favourite packages;
  - Something that you want to learn but don’t know where to start with;
  - Useful channels to learn R.

(Note you don’t have to give a talk.)

These will be informal talks and we are really friendly people, so don’t
be stressed\! We would recommend keeping your talk short and concise,
5-10 minutes will be perfect. We could always schedule your longer talks
in the coming events.

Please come along to brainstorm, meet people, have fun and enjoy some
goodies\!

A big thank you to the Nous Group who are providing the venue and
catering for this event\!
